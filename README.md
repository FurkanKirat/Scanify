# Seeker

A fast, lightweight desktop search tool built with Avalonia UI. Seeker indexes
your files for instant name-based search, and separately lets you search
*inside* file contents (text, code, docs) without needing a pre-built index.

## Features

### 🔍 File Name Search
- Index a specific folder (or several) or your whole PC
- Instant, debounced search as you type
- Keyboard navigation (`↓` to jump into results, `Esc` to clear)

### 📄 Content Search
- Search inside file contents — not just names
- Supports plain text and code files out of the box (`.txt`, `.md`, `.cs`,
  `.py`, `.js`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.csv`, `.yaml`, and more)
- Shows a matching snippet alongside each result
- Skips unreadable files (locked, corrupt, unsupported) without stopping the scan

### ⚡ Quick Actions (right-click any result)
- **Open** — launch with the default associated app
- **Show in File Manager** — reveal and select the file in Explorer
- **Copy Path** — copy the full path to clipboard
- **Open in Terminal** — open a terminal at the file's folder
- **Open in Editor** — automatically detects installed editors (VS Code,
  Rider, Notepad++, ...) on your `PATH` and lists only the ones compatible
  with the selected item (e.g. Notepad++ only shows up for files, not folders)

## Why

Most file search tools stop at file names. Seeker adds a second mode for
searching *inside* files, plus the small quality-of-life actions (terminal,
editor, explorer) that turn "found it" into "now I can actually use it" —
without leaving the app.

## Tech Stack

- **.NET** / C#
- **Avalonia UI** — cross-platform UI framework
- Platform-specific shell integration behind an `IPlatformShell` abstraction
  (Windows implemented; Linux/macOS scaffolded)

## Architecture Notes

- `FileIndex` — in-memory file name index, built once per scan
- `ContentSearcher` + `ExtractorRegistry` — pluggable content extraction per
  file extension
- `IPlatformShell` — abstracts OS-specific actions (open file, show in file
  manager, open terminal, open in editor) behind a single interface, so the
  UI layer never touches `Process.Start` directly
- `EditorDetector` — detects installed editors on `PATH` at startup and
  caches the result
- `EditorTargetResolver` — resolves whether an editor expects a file or a
  directory, and filters incompatible combinations before they ever reach
  the shell layer
- Every shell action returns a `ShellActionResult` (success/failure +
  exception), so the UI can report *why* something failed instead of
  silently swallowing errors

## Status

Actively developed as a personal tool / learning project. Windows is the
primary target; the shell abstraction is designed to make Linux/macOS
support straightforward to add later.
